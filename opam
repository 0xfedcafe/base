Full standard library replacement for OCaml

Base is a complete and portable alternative to the OCaml standard
library. It provides all standard functionalities one would expect
from a language standard library. It uses consistent convension across
all its module.

Base aims to be usable in any context. As a result system dependant
features such as IO are not offered by Base. They are instead provided
by companion libraries such as stdio:
